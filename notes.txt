What is my current strategy?
-----------------------------

Bets are placed on what?
    Typically
        - player points over
        - team points over

    Sometimes
        - assists
        - boards 
        - player points under
        - game win

    If player points over selected
        what do I know about this player to make this choice?
            - should know last years performance
            - should know current season performance
            - should know injury status

            - is team reliant on this scorer?
            - does this person get enough shot attempts?
            - need to know variance of points scored from
